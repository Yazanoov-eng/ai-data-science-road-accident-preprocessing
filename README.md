Road Accident Data Preprocessing (Phase 1)
=========================================

This project prepares a road-accident dataset for machine learning by performing full data
cleaning, preprocessing, and target/feature selection. The goal of Phase 1 is to transform
raw CSV data into a structured and reliable dataset that can be used for predictive modeling
in Phase 2.

Contents
--------

- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline (Python)
- Handling missing values and normalization
- Duplicate removal and data type fixing
- Feature engineering to improve dataset quality
- Exporting a cleaned dataset for later ML use

Dataset
-------

The dataset files are not included in this repository.

To run the project:
1. Download the dataset (Accident.csv)
2. Place it in the project directory (or inside a data/ folder)
3. Update the file path inside the script if needed

Expected file name:
- Accident.csv


Output
------

The script generates a cleaned dataset (CSV) ready for machine learning in Phase 2.
