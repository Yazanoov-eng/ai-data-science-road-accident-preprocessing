AI Data Science Road Accident Preprocessing
===========================================

This project prepares a road-accident dataset for machine learning by performing full data
cleaning and preprocessing using Python. The goal is to transform raw CSV data into a
structured and reliable dataset ready for further analysis or modeling.

Main Tasks
----------

- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- Handling missing values
- Duplicate removal
- Data type correction
- Normalization / scaling
- Feature engineering
- Exporting a cleaned dataset

Dataset
-------

The dataset CSV files are not included in this repository.

To run the project:
1. Download the dataset file (Accident.csv)
2. Place it in the project directory (or inside a data/ folder)
3. Update the file path in the script if needed

Expected file name:
- Accident.csv

Output
------

The script generates a cleaned dataset (CSV) after applying preprocessing steps.

Running
-------

python src/DS1.py
